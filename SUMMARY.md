I started using Linux ever since the release of Windows 8. Because I kept running into issues, from not being able to install certain packages to boot failures, I have started to learn basic troubleshooting skills, including the old, tried and true RTFM. This led me to many different rabbit holes, like distro hopping, DE/WM hopping, and ricing my Linux System to make my deskop experience look pretty. I started this blog as a way to document my projects, CTF writeups and things I learn.
