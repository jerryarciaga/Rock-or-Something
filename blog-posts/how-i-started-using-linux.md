# How I started using Linux
## Before using Linux
More than 10 years ago, I didn't think about using anything other than Windows. The earlier versions of Windows were more than enough for me to do school work, gaming, social media and entertainment. I turn on my computer, launch a program or two and then turn it back off. Computing was simple back then.
## Why I started switching into Linux
Then came Windows 8 and its touchscreen-centric UI design. Pressing the Start button no longer summons the application tray; it brings you to a whole another screen -- separate to your desktop screen -- which lets you select your apps in a way that's more efficient when done using a touch screen. This is also when I started seeing ads on my Start Menu. For an operating system people pay money to get a license for, this felt like a ripoff. This is when I started looking for alternatives. I thought about getting myself a MacBook, but they were too expensive for me at the time. I was searching around Google, then discovered Linux.
## The year of the Linux Desktop
I heard from a podcast I listen to that the year of the Linux desktop is actually different from person to person. For me, it's around 2014 because that's the first time I started learning how to flash an `.iso` file to a USB thumb drive, then boot into it by getting to the BIOS settings and boot menu. I don't remember what Desktop Environment Ubuntu had at the moment, but I remembered that the whole experience felt strange at first, then I got comfortable with it. I even started learning the keybindings that came with it.
